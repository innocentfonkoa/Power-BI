RI_Expanision Nganzi_LGA Post Campaign Feedback Dashboard.

Due to insurgency in Northeast Nigeria, RI sessions and activities in Borno were only available in wards and settlements that are accessible to health workers;
However, in an effort to expand and improve RI coverage in the State, the Borno SPHCDA with the support of its partners conceived and planned RI Expansion (RIE) activities in partially accessible wards, leveraging on the existing framework provided by the Reach Every settlement (RES) program. The RIE strategy deployed two types of sessions to ensure all eligible children in partially accessible settlements are reached with RI antigens. The two sessions area Safe Fixed Post Session (RIE-SFP) and Mobile Session (RIE-MS).
 18 LGAs with partially accessible wards are the primary targets of the RIE strategy, Which Nganzi LGA is one of them. RI Expansion Nganzi LGA Post Campaign Feedback 2019 Dashboard, gives us a detail analysis on How many settlements was planned, Total number of Wards planned, Total number of Mobile Session settlements planned, Total number of Safe Fixed Post sessions planned for the LGA. The Dashboard also shows us the different levels of coverages, settlements Reached, settlements Not reached, settlements with Valid Tracks and Settlements with invalid Tracks. And you can also drill down to see the settlements by ward, so as to know the specific settlements that were reached and had valid Tracks in the ward.
